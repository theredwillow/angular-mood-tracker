Monstera Moodtracker
-------

This project was inspired by [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/wcosjz/a_dead_leaf_and_a_few_wilty_spots_but_was_still/) on [r/bulletjournal](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal) by [u/cirinalynn](https://www.reddit.com/user/cirinalynn/). She used the parts of monstera leaves as a moodtracker. I found this fascinating and thought it would be cool to practice my Angular skills by manipulating an SVG of it.

Monstera Moodtracker
-------

This project was inspired by [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/wcosjz/a_dead_leaf_and_a_few_wilty_spots_but_was_still/) on [r/bulletjournal](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal) by [u/cirinalynn](https://www.reddit.com/user/cirinalynn/). She used the parts of monstera leaves as a moodtracker. I found this fascinating and thought it would be cool to practice my Angular skills by manipulating an SVG of it. 

This project was shared with the reddit community through my [08/06/2022 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/whhdw5/mood_tracker_website_inspired_by_ucirinalynn).


Possible Improvements
-----
* Add calendar tool to allow for user input
* Convert leaf-moodtracker into svg-moodtracker, allow multiple SVG's to be used that follow class naming conventions
* Add background to leaf-moodtracker SVG
* Dynamic leaf generation / allowing user to make separate leaves for distinct periods, such as travel dates


Future inspirations
-----
* u/Todaymademestronger's [October/spooky eyeball jar moodtracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/qjs6cl/finished_moodtracker_october/)
* u/goingbananas2002's [November/turkey moodtracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/bulletjournal/comments/9r9c3s/moodtracker_november/)
IDEA: Make turkey's mouth move with the average happiness rating
* Night sky that adds as many stars to the sky as the mood rating is for that date
